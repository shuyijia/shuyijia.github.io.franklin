## Shuyi Jia 「郏舒逸」

I am a first-year CSE PhD student at Georgia Tech, supervised by Prof. [Victor Fung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2QsddMIAAAAJ). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg). Previously, I have worked with Prof. [Wei Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n41KN9AAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) on language models, Prof. [Dario Poletti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Kr25TGUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) on applying machine learning methods to quantum many-body systems, and Prof. [Kang Hao Cheong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=neaUULMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) on Parrondo's paradox.

## Research

My research interests lie in **machine learning** and **computational science**.
With theoretical understanding, I'm also interested in doing research with a strong social impact
and addressing fundamental problems in natural sciences, especially in the fields of computational physics and chemistry.
