## Shuyi Jia 「郏舒逸」

I am a third-year student at [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg),
majoring in Computer Science and Design (CSD), a CS degree sprinkled with
doses of engineering, design and social sciences.

I am also a member of the pioneer batch of [SHARP](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/SHARP), a premier
research-oriented programme that offers advanced classes and
interdisciplinary research opportunities. I am currently working on
interpretability of NLP models, mentored by Prof. [Lu Wei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n41KN9AAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
Previously, I have worked with Prof. [Dario Poletti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Kr25TGUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) on applying machine learning methods to quantum many-body systems,
and Prof. [Cheong Kang Hao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=neaUULMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) on Parrondo's paradox.

## Research

My research interests lie in **machine learning** and **computational science**.
With theoretical understanding, I'm also interested in doing research with a strong social impact
and addressing fundamental problems in natural sciences, especially in the fields of computational physics and chemistry.
